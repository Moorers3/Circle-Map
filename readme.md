
## Introduction

    This web map is a circle map that shows the difference in cancer rates between states and includes Washington DC. Using a circle map you can visually see the differences between high rates and low rates by the varying circle sizes. Using markdown language and VS Studio to write the code I was able to turn this map into my own when implementing my dataset.

## Major Functions

    The functions of this project are: An interactive web map with mouseover functions as well as color changes. Zoom functions with circle size variations. 

## Libraries

    Libraries used include, Leaflet for the Stadia basemap, VS Studio to write the code, GeoJson for implementing the markers for the circles as well as implementing the data. Excel for sorting and organizing my dataset. 

## Data Sources

    Data sources include world population review for my data on cancer rates across US states in 2025, and Stadia maps for the basemap through Leaflet.
